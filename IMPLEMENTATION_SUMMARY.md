  - User activity and login times

### 6. Firestore Integration ✅

- **Enhanced**: `client/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- **User Document Structure**:
  ```javascript
  {
    email: string,
    displayName: string,
    createdAt: timestamp,
    lastLogin: timestamp,
    subscriptionStatus: 'trial' | 'active' | 'cancelled' | 'expired',
    plan: 'individual' | 'clinic',
    trialStarted: timestamp,
    totalSOAPGenerated: number,
    lastActivity: timestamp,
    subscriptionStarted?: timestamp,
    stripeSubscriptionId?: string
  }
  ```

### 7. Navigation Updates ✅

- Added admin link in main navigation for admin users
- Updated "Start Free Trial" buttons to redirect to signup
- Added admin badge for admin users
- Maintained consistent design across all pages

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

1. User clicks "Start Free Trial" on pricing page
2. If not authenticated → redirected to `/signup`
3. Plan selection stored in `localStorage`
4. After signup/login → automatic redirect to Stripe checkout
5. Successful checkout → Success page with subscription tracking

### Admin Dashboard Access

- Email-based access control
- Real-time Firestore queries
- Automated calculations for metrics
- Export capabilities (prepared for CSV)
- Responsive charts and data visualization

### Analytics Pipeline

- User creation → Firestore user document
- SOAP generation → increment counter
- Trial start → update subscription status
- Subscription conversion → track revenue

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files

- `client/pages/Signup.tsx` - User registration with trial flow
- `client/pages/Admin.tsx` - Admin dashboard with analytics
- `client/lib/analytics-service.ts` - User activity tracking service
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files

- `client/App.tsx` - Added signup and admin routes
- `client/pages/Pricing.tsx` - Added authentication requirement
- `client/pages/Login.tsx` - Added pending plan handling
- `client/pages/Index.tsx` - Updated navigation and trial buttons

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Signup Flow**: Test account creation with different plans
2. **Admin Access**: Verify only admin emails can access `/admin`
3. **Analytics**: Generate SOAP notes and verify tracking
4. **Trial Conversion**: Complete trial signup to subscription
5. **Data Persistence**: Check Firestore for accurate data storage

## Security Considerations

- Admin access restricted by email whitelist
- Firestore security rules should be configured
- User data properly encrypted in transit
- No sensitive data exposed in client-side code

## Future Enhancements

- CSV export functionality for user data
- Advanced filtering and search in admin dashboard
- Email notifications for trial expirations
- Detailed user activity logs
- Revenue forecasting and trends
- A/B testing for conversion optimization
